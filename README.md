# Automobile Mileage Prediction with Linear Regression

In this project, I embarked on a journey into the realm of machine learning, specifically focusing on predicting automobile mileage using Linear Regression. With a dataset comprising 12 variables and over 400 observations, I delved deep into understanding mileage patterns and uncovering insights that could aid in predictive modeling.

Approach:

* Data Exploration: Leveraging Python libraries such as pandas and sklearn, I meticulously explored the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying key variables that could influence mileage prediction.

* Challenges Faced: One significant hurdle encountered was the deceptive nature of the Horsepower column, which required careful preprocessing to ensure its accurate representation in the model. Additionally, handling missing values and outliers posed challenges that demanded robust solutions.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through rigorous EDA, I unearthed hidden insights within the dataset, revealing correlations and patterns that guided feature selection and model refinement.

* Model Training: Armed with a thorough understanding of the data, I proceeded to train a Linear Regression model using sklearn. By iteratively adjusting parameters and features, I honed the model's predictive capabilities.

* Performance Evaluation: The culmination of this endeavor resulted in an impressive adjusted R-squared value of 0.86, indicative of the model's ability to explain a significant portion of the variance in the data.

Conclusion:

This project exemplifies the triumph of exploration and the transformative potential of machine learning in unraveling complex patterns and making accurate predictions. By navigating through challenges and leveraging the power of data-driven insights, I demonstrated the efficacy of Linear Regression in the domain of automobile mileage prediction.

Feel free to explore the code and findings presented in this repository, and I welcome any feedback or contributions that could further enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
